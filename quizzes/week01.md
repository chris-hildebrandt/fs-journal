**1.** In the terminal, what is the command `cd` used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

"cd" is used to change directory, or to navigate from your current folder into the specified target folder.
```

**2.** In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

"mkdir" is used to create a new folder. The name of the new folder should be entered after the space following the aforementioned command.
```

**3.** What is the `\<html>\</html>` tag in a document?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The tag shows up at the beginning and end of an HTML document (know as the root element). it indicates that the webpage is written in HTML5, and all other page markup comes in between these beginning and ending tags
```

**4.** What does `HTML` stand for?

hyper text markup language.
```

**5.** What Does `CSS` stand for?

**6.** What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:
```
css
 h1.main-title {
   color : rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
 }
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The SELECTOR identifies the target element that will be affected.

the PROPERTY is the text before the colon, and describes the key or attribute that is affected by the rule.

the VALUE following the colon sets the rule to the desired value.
 
In the example the SELECTOR "h1.main-title" targets any h1 div with the "main-title" class, the PROPERTY being modified in this case is "color", and the VALUE is being set to "rgba(255, 210, 33, .75)
```

**7.** What property would you change if you wanted to make a font **Bold**?

font-weight. You could also do this with <b> tags in line, or use the built in "tw-bold" utility class with bootstrap
```

**8.** In what tag does the majority of your code belong?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

The majority of your code should be within the <body></body> tags. This is the portion of the code which, in general, displays directly to the page.
```

**9.** What three tags can be used to make lists (not list items)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<ol> -ordered lists
<ul> -unordered lists
<dl> -definition lists
```

**10.** Define the display `:flex property:`
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
this sets the flexible length on flex items
```

**11.** What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
there are sooo many! you can directly adjust the width and height with keys like "min-width", "max-height" etc, you can also adjust size by changing the margins, padding, and borders. I think you can also have a parent element affect the size rather than changing the box directly.
