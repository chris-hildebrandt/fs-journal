# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more. Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class. Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In computer programming, the strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of programming where coding, testing, and design are tightly interwoven.
Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Definition of Done (DoD) represents the organization's formal definition of quality for all Product Backlog Items (PBIs). If an organization does not have one, the Scrum team should set its own. The Definition of Done is the commitment contained within the Increment artifact.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.

A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. 

The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer. Note that "customers" don't have to be external end users in the traditional sense, they can also be internal customers or colleagues within your organization who depend on your team.

User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome. They don't go into detail. Requirements are added later, once agreed upon by the team.

"As Max, I want to invite my friends, so we can enjoy this service together."

"As a manager, I want to be able to understand my colleagues progress, so I can better report our sucess and failures. ""

**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Sprint Planning
This ceremony helps to set up the entire team for the coming sprint, creating a smooth pathway for a successful sprint. Sprint planning requires the participation of all the scrum roles: the development team, scrum master and the product owner. The planning, of course, is prior to the sprint. It typically lasts for an hour or two.

The product owner comes to the meeting with a prioritized list of the product backlog items, which is presented to the group. The items on the list, which are also called user stories, are then discussed with the development team. Together, they estimate what it will take to complete the items on the list. From this information, the development team makes a sprint forecast. They will outline how much work the team can complete from the product backlog. This will be known as the sprint backlog.
