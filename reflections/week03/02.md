## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

To prevent timing dependencies and resource conflicts caused by trying to share the same memory resources between different operations running in non-deterministic sequences.The trouble with shared mutable state is that if your input state depends on some other instruction‚Äôs output state, and any sort of concurrency arises, it creates race conditions. If you change the order in which instructions are called, it can alter the results. Mix in any sort of non-determinism in sequencing, and the result is chaos: unpredictable, unprovable, seemingly random application state. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Not only does encapsulation provide a solution to these problems, but it provides protective layering to our AppState and information and processes we don't want the user to have access to.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Breaking Changes: Internal properties and methods tend to change more frequently than public properties and methods. For many, underscore prefixed methods, e.g., myComponent._handleClick refer to methods that they do not intend users of the API to call directly. Instead, they‚Äôre used only internally, and as such, if their implementations change, or if they‚Äôre entirely deleted, those developers would not consider that to be a breaking change.

Unfortunately for the users, many new developers are unaware of the underscore prefix convention, so may use the properties anyway. Experienced developers often know what it means, but figure, ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing‚Äù, and so use them anyway ‚Äî particularly if it provides an obvious solution to a current problem. In other words, a large number of people ignore the convention, and that leads to more breaking changes than necessary.

Leaked Implementation Details: Remember the example above, where we started out supporting only arrays, but now we want to expand our support to streams? Well, if your users have direct access to the underlying data structures, they may create dependencies on those data structures, so the first time a stream is encountered, they‚Äôre surprised when their code breaks.

Expanded Attack Surface for Hackers: On public APIs in particular, adding any more surface API than is necessary to use your code expands the surface area that is available for attackers to exploit. One of the most important principles of software security to limit the attack surface only to what is absolutely necessary. If you really only intend for something to be used internally, it should not be exposed externally.

Self Documenting Code: Your public API should be as self-documenting as possible. One way to do that is to expose only those methods and properties you intend for your users to use. That way users are not tempted to use unsupported and undocumented methods. If you use the underscore convention, you rely on the user to know what it means and to understand that you don‚Äôt intend for them to use it. If you use encapsulation, you don‚Äôt have to worry about that. They can‚Äôt use what they don‚Äôt have access to.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

A variable defined in a factory or constructor function scope is private to that function.

Any other functions defined in the same scope are privileged:
These both have access to the private `count` variable defined anywhere in their scope chain (containing function scopes).

factory functions and true privacy using closure-based encapsulation over using classes and the new class fields specification, but if you actually need encapsulation, both closures and class fields are far better than underscores, because they don‚Äôt rely on convention, and instead enforce true encapsulation.
