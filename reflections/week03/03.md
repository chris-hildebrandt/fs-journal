## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

get and set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

when you override the return of a value with a customized action, the value is never actually read so it returns the customized response and undefined. to access the value at the key you need to input 2 parameters in the get: the object being accessed and the property key.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Proxies allow you to provide custom functionality to basic operations that can be performed on an Object. From what I can gather, these open up a lot of customization for responding to access and edit requests on specified objects. It not only allows for denying access to certain objects, but it also allows customized handlers when allowing such access.
