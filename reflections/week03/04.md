> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

 the problem of keeping a bunch of elements synced with the same data, especially due to user input in real-time, without third-party dependencies.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?


 subscribe: adds new observable events

 unsubscribe: removes observable events

 broadcast: executes all events with bound data


3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

through the use of event listeners and the MVC pattern the one to many syncing capabilities of ECMA6 are put to use allowing user input to be routed through varying layers of code with dynamic responses drawing to the page in response.
