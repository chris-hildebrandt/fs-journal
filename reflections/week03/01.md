## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

using multiple HTML script tags, which disrupts processing and affects page performance.

2. How does export differ from export default?

export gives access to the function while export default accesses the values

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code can be split into smaller files of self-contained functionality.

Multiple scripts can be concatenated thereby increasing performance.

Debugging becomes easier.

Any code referencing a module understands it is a dependency. If the module file is changed or moved, the problem is immediately obvious.

Modules (usually) helps eradicate naming conflicts. 

ES6 Modules are always executed in strict mode, so there is no need for 'use strict'.
