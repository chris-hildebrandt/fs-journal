## Questions

1. What are props?

Props are a type of parameter/argument data passing process used in vue. We typically use them to pass properties from v-for loop iterations for access to individual instances of the object properties for access by children components/elements 

2. What are props used for?

Props are used to pass variables and other information around between different components. This is similar to how in Javascript we can pass variables into functions as arguments

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

the props are declared in the vue script section under the setup() at the top which is typically the private section, and they are accessed in the html however, since Vue uses one way data flow, that data can only flow from a parent into a child component. You cannot pass data from a child to a parent.
