## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (aka components) into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems. You can think of a component as a small feature that makes up a piece of the user interface. If I were to describe a component within the scope of Facebook‚Äôs UI, A chat window would be a component, a comment feed would be another component, and a constantly updating friend list would represent yet another component.
Each of these components exist within the same space, yet interact independently from one another. Components have their own structure, their own methods and their own APIs. Components are also reusable and can be ‚Äúpasted‚Äù into interfaces at will. The independent nature of components allows for developers to create a UI with many different moving parts.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

when working on a single feature for an application, the developer can manage, manipulate, and see all of the code in one docukent rather than chasing the interactions and functions over many different documents. this coupled with the standalone nature of the component make it very easy to develop and test different features of the app with a reduced risk for spelling errors or syntax issues breaking the entire app due to iterdependencies and long trails of code. 

the reactive nature of the framework further aids in development and testing by reducing the number of steps to see changes made to the app reflected on the viewport. There are major speed benefits as well because the app can dynamically draw only the small pieces of the page that are being updated rather than refreshing the entire app.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

the major drawback is that larger applications with many different independent "components" can quickly become bloated with page after page of components making the big picture of the app very difficult to view and read. frameworks like vue and react make coding on the small scale so much simpler and easier that developers may be tempted to ignore MVC patterns which would be much more organized on the large scale.
