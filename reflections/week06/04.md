## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

it is essentially a subpage or child of a page, and allows for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

If I wanted to build an app that catalogued weapons and armor, I might find it necessary or preferable to make sub-pages in the weapon page for different types of weapons rather than trying to dump all the information on one page, i could link a new page for swords and edged weapons, and another for clubs, maces, and other bludgeoning weapons. this would help keep the information concise for the user and the code easier to read and manage for the developer.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

yes, you can pass parameters through the router using route.params /:params. and this would be useful for situations like car parts dealers who want to pass specific make/model information down to nested pages to list relevant parts for the headlights for instance, so that only parts matching the parameters are listed.
