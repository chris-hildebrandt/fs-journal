## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

we use git because it offers a safe storage of our code, allows us to save multiple states of that code, in case we need to revert to an older state, and it allows multiple users and multiple devices to access and edit that code. Git also allows for the creation of branches of the same code running in parallel so that you can have a functional published page while also working on updates etc. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

This allows testing of code or development of parallel coding projects which can be tested individually before merging the changes together.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

github is a website that stores your git repositories remotely, git is the source control software which is used by github and vscode to create, store, and distribute your repositories. github also offers other cool services like page hosting and user profiles which can help track productivity and showcase your abilities.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

our assignment was to write this first journal entry. I would say that the takeaway for me is that there is a lot of new terminology and information that we will be learning, and it will be very helpful to write some of the info down in order to reference it later, and to help us cement the terms in our memory.
