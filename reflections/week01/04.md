## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

to quickly and efficiently mock up a design for a website before putting all the time and effort into coding one. this reduces the amount of tinkering that needs to be done with the code, and it gives a clearer direction for the work. it also makes the development focused on the user experience and can provide a useful road-map for features and content.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low-fidelity wire frames are the roughest version, usually just sketches of basic layout without any actual images or content, they help start the design process. this is also useful if the design is going to change a lot or if there are a lot of people involved in the design.

mid-fidelity wire-frames are the most commonly used, they are much more detailed and feature specific but still more of an outline than a blueprint.

high-fidelity wire-frames are usually made with utilities like figma and are pixel specific design blueprints. Wire-frames with this much detail are best saved for the end of a design process as they take a lot of time to create, but tools like figma help to bridge the gap between design and construction allowing the coders to copy/paste specific attributes and values from the wire-frame.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Considering how much time it took us to clone a design I would have to say that wire frames are not just worthwhile, they are necessary. It would just take too much time and effort to try and code while designing. I personally do not like the process of wire-framing or mock-ups in general, I would rather tackle the coding portion and leave the design to someone else entirely, but if I had to design something from scratch I would probably do a low-fidelity wire-frame first.
