## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A pseudo-class targets an element when a specific condition or state is true. For example the :hover selector only applies when the element is being hovered over. Other examples that I think will be very useful are :checked and :visited which can be used to make visible changes to elements that have been clicked by the viewer.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the system that css uses to prioritize the values assigned to properties when more than one selector targets that property. The default order through which styles are applied is simply that the last line of code read applies. So if specificity is equal, the line that is lower on your code will be applied and override previous lines. However, you can use the specificity rules to make some styles more important or specific. For example you can set the background color of the body { which would have a specificity of 1, and then target other elements through .class { selectors with a different color, which would get priority because class selectors have a specificity of 10. There are other more specific selectors as well, and the selectors can be combined for a cumulative specificity. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

With !important the specificity is set so high that it is not possible to override it through normal selector specificity. This could be a big problem if you need to adjust those properties in the future.
