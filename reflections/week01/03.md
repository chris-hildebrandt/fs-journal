## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite tip was definitely utilizing opacity to make text pull in some of the background color. I definitely would have wasted some time trying to match and lighten the background color manually before hearing this particular tip.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Website design definitely sets the tone for how professional and trustworthy a company is. The more attractive a website is, and the smoother the navigation, the more willing a person is to explore and read the content. On the other hand, we have all seen websites that resemble dilapidated buildings, you know, the kind that you wouldn't step inside of for fear of it collapsing around you. I'm sure there are legitimate sites that can't get traction because the design makes people afraid to enter.
