## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

testing in software development is the analysis of code, typically through usage, which demonstrates whether a unit of code performs the tas it was designed to do, if it does so efficiently, and if there are other side effects of the code use.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

testing provides peace of mind that the code we have in place can be relied upon. It also forces us to think more analytically about the edge cases where bugs and errors might occur. In-depth testing instils confidence in our work and makes us appear much more professional when we turn in a polished and functional product to the QA team, our teammembers, and our customers. Testing is also more efficient than turning in untested code and trying to repair it later when it comes back with problems. this is especially important in large teams or in cases where the person who wrote the code won;t actually be the one trying to make updates and repairs when it is sent back. testing is also a great way to provide documentation and leads to an overall better product design. 

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

time is always a potential loss and a pressing constraint. extra time means extra expense in man hours and total cost to the client. I suppose it could be dangerous to be overconfident in our own testing, making teams or businesses try to replace professional qa with unit testing which could lead to major problems if unit testing is not performed to industry standard QA testing.
