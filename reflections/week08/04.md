## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

unit testing:
Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to provide developers with confidence in their code. By writing thorough, meaningful tests, you achieve the confidence that as new features are built or your code is refactored your application will remain functional and stable.
Unit testing a Vue application does not significantly differ from testing other types of applications.

component testing:
To test most Vue components, they must be mounted to the DOM (either virtual or real) in order to fully assert that they are working. This is another framework-agnostic concept. As a result, component testing frameworks were created to give users the ability to do this in a reliable way while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.

end to end testing:
While unit tests provide developers with some degree of confidence, unit and component tests are limited in their abilities to provide holistic coverage of an application when deployed to production. As a result, end-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications.
In other words, E2E tests validate all of the layers in your application. This not only includes your frontend code, but all associated backend services and infrastructure that are more representative of the environment that your users will be in. By testing how user actions impact your application, E2E tests are often the key to higher confidence in whether an application is functioning properly or not.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

the most useful testing to me personally is unit testing simply because it is the one I am most likely to use at this point in my education, it helps me think of each piece the project both as a part of a larger app, and as a simplified componnent piece. it helps me to analyze and better understand the code.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

component testing seems to be the least useful simply because it is so specific to vue and is not as easily generalized to other programming languages and frameworks. that being said it seems very similar to unit testing in that vue has already provided a structured approach to creating components for an app ina a somewhat isolated way. therefore, component testing done right is essentially unit testing.
