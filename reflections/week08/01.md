essentially it is a collection of those projects you have contributed to which provide concrete evidence of your skills, knowledge, and abilities. 

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

having many portfolio pieces to choose from is effective because it allows a greater slection flexibility when trying to show off particular skills. it is also important to have pieces that you actually care about. knowing how and why you built an app will allow you to show it off in a more confident and energized manner, and having skin in the game by creating projects for freinds or family can be very beneficial because you will be more inclined to mak a polished product.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would definitely include this capstone project and my moonminer app. These two projects are the ones that I personally got the most excited about, and because of that I am much more comfortable talking about the code and sharing the logic behind our syntax. there are a few other projects that I am proud of because the finished product looks nice like my wayfare app. the network, and the tower, but I will not be as excited to show those off because I cared less wbout the app and more about getting all the checkboxes for the assignment.
