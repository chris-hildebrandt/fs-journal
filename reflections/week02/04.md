## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

A plan allows for clearer, goal oriented, and end-user-oriented coding. It also allows for cleaner code. by making a plan and doing high quality research and preparation, you will have higher quality code which requires less debugging, and is easier to read and adjust down the road.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Ask questions. It is a good practice to research the question online, chances are someone else has had the same problems you have, and resources like reddit, google, and stack-overflow are full of more than just answers, they are full of discussions with multiple solutions! that being said it isn;t ever a good idea to just copy/paste code without understanding how it works, but the internet is full of resources to help you understand the underlying logic of your problem. 
It is also a good idea to reach out to others in our field. We have friends and mentors who seem pretty cool and willing to offer advice as long as we are brave enough to ask for input. 
Lastly I think it is important to take a break if you are stuck, it can be very beneficial to get some exercise and give your brain a break from the problem. I have often found that when I come back with a rested mind the solution becomes much more obvious.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."

â€” John Woods

I worry much more about functionality than readability, and the result is that I often cannot interpret my own ideas and attempts. If I don't know what I was trying to do how on earth will someone else be able to figure it out?
