## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

scope describes what portion of the code has access to the variable. If a variable is globally scoped any place in the code that calls for it will be able to access the value, however a variable that is functionally scoped is only accessible from within the function in which the variable is declared.

2. What is Hoisting ?

hoisting is a var feature where the variable is moved to the top of its scope before code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

if you wanted to be able to redeclare a variable, or access it outside of a block, you might want to use "var" (or just write your code better). 
if you want to have a variable that remains constant, it cannot be re-declared or updated, you should use const.
for all other variable needs you would want to use let. keep in mind that it is block scoped.
