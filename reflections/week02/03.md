## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log(), and return

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

the Elements tab does this, and it is extremely useful for allowing you to make changes on the fly such as turning on or off styling, adjusting the values of different styles, updating, changing, or adding new classes to divs, or even temporarily coding in new html/css to see what it looks like on the page without the need to go back and forth from your browser to your code. you can even copy/paste the new values to your code, knowing that they look the way you want them too.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

using the built-in "debugger" is a fantastic way to step through a piece of code and see what is happening. you can also use some styles that help visually display what your code is doing on the webpage.
