## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

named function: function name(parameters){}, 
anonymous function: function(parameters){}, 
and shorthand anonymous: (parameters) => {}.
The definitions of a named function are hoisted, anonymous functions do not have their definitions hoisted, and shorthand anonymous functions do not have their own "this" value.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when defining a function, they are the names created in the function definition.
Arguments, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed (invoked).

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher-order functions use other functions as parameters or else they return a function.
