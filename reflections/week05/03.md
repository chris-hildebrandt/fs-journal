## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a calendar-based practice that re-imposes boundaries on your day (your time) with predetermined blocks of time (boxes). You simply devote a certain time box to a certain task.
It is a simple and effective time management technique that involves assigning fixed units of time to an activity or task in advance and then completing that activity or task during the designated time frame. Each task, no matter how large or small, is given a specific time box that serves as a deadline. That‚Äôs your time to get it done. It‚Äôs both an organizing principle and time management technique that makes you acutely aware of what you need to do and how much time you should devote to it.  In practice, the designating of tasks replacing a to-do list with a calendar: whenever there‚Äôs a new activity for you to do, you devote a specific amount of time in your schedule to tackle it (i.e., put it in your calendar), and then commit to doing it in that ‚Äútime box‚Äù.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

the two-minute rule: if a task can be completed in two minutes or less, do it immediately rather than adding it to your list. I think this will help keep my list of things to do from becoming overwhelming.
strategic quitting: the idea that it is better to spend less time on a stubborn problem than grinding away at it for longer than you planned. pausing to switch gears, or even abandoning the old problem (when possible of course) can be a much more efficient use of time.
swallow the frog: getting the most intimidating or difficult tasks done first.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

any one of our assignments would be a good example of this. I often find myself getting lost in the code because to test my one function I need to draw a button in the model or the index, then I need to write the function in the controller, then I need to pass it to the service, etc. etc. and I typically get distracted halfway by styling the button, which leads me to importing fonts and or icons, which takes me back to my pagelayout because the button doesn't look as good as I thought it would in that corner, and now all my text needs to be moved around, and then i realize I need four more buttons and I want to see where they go, and then I find myself writing three different functions at the same time and I never finished the first button so now I've been coding for three hours and haven't tested anything! so yes, timeboxing has the potential to force me into more structured, intentional progress, by helping me place tasks in order and tackling them for a specific amount of time before moving on.
