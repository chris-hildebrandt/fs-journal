## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

linking, especially the hybrid bucket style, can prevent server overload by reducing reads to batches instead of trying to load hundreds or thousands of documents at once. there is a 16 mb limit to the size of a single document and linking can help prevent you from hitting that limit.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

when making a query for n:m relationships, we have to perform two queries in both directions. this can be very complicated! 
some categories might have thousands of relationships in it, with many new relations consistently being added and removed. This makes it impracticable to embed all the relations into one category document.
The One Way Embedding strategy chooses to optimize the read performance of a N:M relationship by embedding the references in one side of the relationship. An example might be where several books belong to a few categories but a couple categories have many books.
