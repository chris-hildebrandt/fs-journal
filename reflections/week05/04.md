## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

they are additional model functions, returning values based on the default schema fields. they allow you to do getter and setter functions using the model fields without requiring static model entries. 

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

we use them to help facilitate many-to-many relationships, but they can also be used to do things like split and concatenate static properties.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

you can't query the virtual field properties, but you can call them like functions ie schema.virtual('virtualProperty').get etc.
