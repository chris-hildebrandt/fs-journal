## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

SSL certificates are a small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

The umbrellas that SSL certificates fall under are encryption and validation, and domain number. They each have three classifications, and can be applied for on the SSL website. Certificates are processed by a Certificate Authority (CA), which is software designed specifically for running and granting these certificates.

For encryption and validation certificates, there are domain, organization, and extended validation. For certificates defined by the domain number, the types are single, multidomain, and wildcard.

Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate
This certificate shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country in the address bar to diminish being mistaken for a spam website.

Extended Validation (SV) SSL are the most expensive SSLs to obtain, but they are valuable in showing the legitimacy of your domain from the address bar. To set up an EV SSL, you must prove that you are authorized to own the domain you‚Äôre submitting. This ensures users that you are legally collecting the data needed to execute certain actions ‚Äî such as a credit card number for an online transaction.

An EV SSL certificate can be obtained by any business, and it should be a priority especially for those that need identity assurance. For instance, if your website processes web payments or collects data, you‚Äôd want to get this certificate.

Organization Validated (OV SSL) Certificate
This certificate verifies that your organization and domain validation are real. Organization Validated (OV) SSL certificates offer a medium level of encryption and are obtained in two steps. First, the CA would verify who owns the domain and if the organization is operating legally.

On the browser, users would see a small green padlock with the company‚Äôs name following. Use this type of certificate if you don‚Äôt have the financial resources for an EV SSL but still want to offer a moderate level of encryption.

Domain Validation (DV) Certificate
The Domain Validation (DV) certificate offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar. This is the quickest validation you can receive, and you‚Äôll only need a few company documents to apply.

This verification happens when you add a DNS to the CA. For this certificate, the CA will review the right of the applicant to own the domain being submitted. (Note: DVs don‚Äôt secure subdomains, just the domain itself).

Unlike the EV SSL, the CA won‚Äôt vet any identity data, so you won‚Äôt know who is receiving your encrypted information. But if you‚Äôre part of a business that can‚Äôt afford a higher-level SSL, a DV gets the job done.

Wildcard SSL Certificates
Wildcard SSL Certificates are in the ‚Äúdomain and subdomain number‚Äù category. Wildcard SSLs ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains.

For example, if you bought a Wildcard for example.com, it could be applied to mail.example.com and blog.example.com. An option like this is cheaper than obtaining multiple SSL certificates for a number or domain.

Unified Communications (UCC) SSL Certificate
Also known as Multi-domain SSL certificates, Unified Communications certificates (UCCs) allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. UCCs were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner.

A UCC in the address bar shows a padlock to display verification. They can also be considered an EV SSL if they are configured to show that green text, padlock, and home country. The only difference is the number of domain names associated with this certificate.

Multi-domain SSL certificates cover up to 100 domain names. If you need to alter the names in any way, you can do that with the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) option. Some examples of Multi-domain names you can use are: www.domain.co.uk, www.domain.com, mail.example.com, and checkout.example.com.

Single Domain SSL Certificate
A Single Domain SSL protects one domain. The thing to remember about this certificate is that you can‚Äôt use it to protect subdomains or a completely different domain.

For example, if you purchase this certificate for example.com, you can‚Äôt use it for blog.example.com or 2ndexample.com.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

when you visit a website that‚Äôs encrypted with SSL, your browser will form a connection with the web server, look at the SSL certificate, then bind your browser and the server. This binding connection is secure to ensure no one besides you and the website can see or access what you type.

This connection happens instantly, and in fact, some suggest it‚Äôs faster than connecting to an unsecure website. You simply have to visit a website with SSL, and voila ‚Äî your connection will automatically be secured.

An SSL is security technology. It‚Äôs a protocol for servers and web browsers that makes sure that data passed between the two are private. This is done using an encrypted link that connects the server and browser.

Companies that request personal information from a user, such as an email address or payment information, should have SSL certificates on their website. Having one means that the details you are collecting are private and ensures the customer that when they see that padlock and https://, their privacy is safe.
