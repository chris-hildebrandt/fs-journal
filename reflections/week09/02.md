## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

Actions can run on any language, including Node.js, Rust, Python, PHP and lots more. Every action creates detailed logs that can be used to troubleshoot deploys in realtime while your actions are running.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

GitHub Actions has a very strong community of developers with several templates of prebuilt actions, examples, and workflows so you donâ€™t have to start from scratch. Feel free to play with it and get familiar so you can leverage this amazing tool.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

There are different types of events that you can call for whenever youâ€™re working with an action:
Workflow
Scheduled
Webhooks
External
These workflow events manage the triggering of the actions. Something like a push, a pull request, or a fork that refers to changes in the repository.
