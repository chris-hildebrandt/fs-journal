## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

primary keys are the unique pieces of information (usually ids) used to differentiate individual rows on a table, foreign keys are references to primary keys on other tables connecting the data between the two using the foreign key to link to the primary.

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is declared following the first instance of the written table name and can be used in place of writting out the full table name. Using appropriately abbreviated aliases allows our code to be more condensed and even dry while still preserving readability.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patientDoctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
I don;t know how to differentiate two tables with the same name, I can of course alias properties, but I doubt the same functionality is possible with a table name. in any case, if the tables were named more specifically, the select would look like this: 
"SELECT p.*, d.* FROM patientDoctors pd JOIN doctors d on pd.doctorId = doctors.id JOIN patients p ON pd.patientId = p.id WHERE pd.doctorId = @id;";
