## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
 this course has been really fun for me, I especially like the creativity allowed in our projects, and the difficulty of the assignments seems perfectly fitted to our level of understanding for each assignment. I have been in higher education for almost twenty years and I have to say that the quality of the instruction and the assignments is top tier. a good assignment is one that both assesses the students understanding, while increasing their understanding through practical application of that knowledge. the checkpoints and assignments do all this while still being fun and engaging. I do wish personally that the career lectures and assignments were either saved for the end of the course, or else available as supplemental material online, like the intro courses. they felt out of place in our curriculum and added stress and pressure where I would have rather focused on the coding assignments.
