## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL injection is a type of attack that can give an adversary complete control over your web application database by inserting arbitrary SQL code into a database query.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?



3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

 Any input to your web application database should be considered untrustworthy and treated accordingly. And listen to the good folks from OWASP when they tell you ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs somewhat shameful that there are so many successful SQL Injection attacks occurring, because it is EXTREMELY simple to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities in your code.‚Äù [their emphasis]

The OWASP SQL injection cheat sheet dives deeper than we ever could here, but preventing SQL injection attacks, the OWASP tell us, requires developers to whitelist input validation (not blacklisting), to use prepared statements with parameterized queries, and to escape all user-supplied input.

Also limit account privileges. Assume a breach. What if a developer fails to sanitize a single user input field? Hey, it happens. Developers are only human. Sanitize input but assume something is going to slip past you. Limit the account privileges of the database user. Is your web application read only, for example? Does it need to have DROP TABLES privileges? Probably not. The principle of least privilege applies here. Give the web application the minimum privileges it needs to run.

Stored procedures can also make SQLi a lot harder ‚Äî although not impossible. If your web application only needs to run a handful of SQL queries, create stored procedures to execute those queries. Typically, only the database administrator has privileges to create or modify stored procedures. Be aware, though, that many databases ship with default stored procedures out of the box, and attackers know this. Consider removing those default stored procedures unless you really need them.
