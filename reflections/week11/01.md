## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

inheritance is a mechanism to share (or reuse) code. On the other hand, inheritance is also a mechanism to imprint identity into a class. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Not all members of a class are inherited. Constructors, for instance, are not and have never been inheritable in CSharp. That means that every class must declare its own constructors. Child classes also donâ€™t inherit finalizers from their parents. Everything else is inherited, but whether itâ€™ll be visible or not depends on the memberâ€™s visibility

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Protected and Internal Members
When it comes to protected members, things are different. Protected members are visible *only *in child classes, which means theyâ€™re supposed to be used in inheritance. Internal members are a little bit different?theyâ€™re visible in derived classes located in the same assembly as the parent class.

Public Members
Finally, inherited public members are not only accessible, theyâ€™re part of the public interface of the child class. They can be normally called as if they were declared in the child class. Youâ€™ve already seen this behavior in action during our first example.
