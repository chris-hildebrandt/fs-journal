# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

1. keep code shallow and avoid anonymous functions
2. Modularize. "Write small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing" by making modules you can remove large chunks of code from the main file and have several specialized files instead.
3. The first two rules are primarily about making your code readable, but this one is about making your code stable. When dealing with callbacks you are by definition dealing with tasks that get dispatched, go off and do something in the background, and then complete successfully or abort due to failure. Any experienced developer will tell you that you can never know when these errors happen, so you have to plan on them always happening.

With callbacks the most popular way to handle errors is the Node.js style where the first argument to the callback is always reserved for an error.
