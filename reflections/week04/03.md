## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

to pause code so that functions or transactions happening elsewhere can occur. this is super helpful when some code is dependent on the results of external functions/transactions

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

you must put "async" in front of the function, and then put await in front of the line of code that you want to pause at

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

The main benefits of asynchronous programming using async / await include the following:

Increase the performance and responsiveness of your application, particularly when you have long-running operations that do not require to block the execution. In this case, you can perform other work while waiting for the result from the long running task.

Organize your code in a neat and readable way significantly better than boilerplate code of the traditional thread creation and handling. with async / await , you write less code and your code will be more maintainable than using the previous asynchronous programming methods such as using plain tasks.

You make use of the latest upgrades of the language features.
