> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

pyramid shaped code, stacks of }) at the end of a file, long, complex, and difficult to read functions. the cause is a desire to handle function priority, the coder wants certain pieces of code to run at certain times, or in a particular order to prevent callback functions from bogging down load times or causing errors.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means happening at a different or later time. A callback is just a way to store some things to do at a later time
The order in which things happen does not read top-to-bottom, it jumps around based on when things complete. Async/wait can be used to do this more explicitly by instructing code to pause for a result of some kind, or callback style functions can be used to start running a function without immediately returning the result, allowing for it to be called later.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

1. keep code shallow and avoid anonymous functions
2.
