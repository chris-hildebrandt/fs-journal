## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

pyramid shaped code, stacks of }) at the end of a file, long, complex, and difficult to read functions. the cause is a desire to handle function priority, the coder wants certain pieces of code to run at certain times, or in a particular order to prevent callback functions from bogging down load times or causing errors.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means happening at a different or later time. A callback is just a way to store some things to do at a later time
The order in which things happen does not read top-to-bottom, it jumps around based on when things complete. Async/wait can be used to do this more explicitly by instructing code to pause for a result of some kind, or callback style functions can be used to start running a function without immediately returning the result, allowing for it to be called later.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Don’t nest functions. Give them names and place them at the top level of your program
Use function hoisting to your advantage to move functions ‘below the fold’
Handle every single error in every one of your callbacks. Use a linter like standard to help you with this.
Create reusable functions and place them in a module to reduce the cognitive load required to understand your code. Splitting your code into small pieces like this also helps you handle errors, write tests, forces you to create a stable and documented public API for your code, and helps with refactoring.
