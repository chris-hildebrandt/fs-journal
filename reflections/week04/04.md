## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

2. What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesnâ€™t remember if the user of the API already sent a GET request for the same resource in the past, it doesnâ€™t remember which resources the user of the API requested before, and so on.
Each individual request contains all the information the server needs to perform the request and return a response, regardless of other requests made by the same API user.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

resource/identifier/resource
What the server does when you, the client, call one of its APIs depends on 2 things that you need to provide to the server:
An identifier for the resource you are interested in. This is the URL for the resource, also known as the endpoint. In fact, URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
The operation you want the server to perform on that resource, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
