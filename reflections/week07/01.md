## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the ‚Äúnavigator‚Äù; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

increased code quality: ‚Äúprogramming out loud‚Äù leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going down blind alleys
better diffusion of knowledge among the team, in particular when a developer unfamiliar with a component is pairing with one who knows it much better
better transfer of skills, as junior developers pick up micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members
large reduction in coordination efforts, since there are N/2 pairs to coordinate instead of N individual developers
improved resiliency of a pair to interruptions, compared to an individual developer: when one member of the pair must attend to an external prompt, the other can remains focused on the task and can assist in regaining focus afterwards

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

While empirical studies have yet to yield definite results on either benefits or costs, a commonly cited best-case estimate of 15% overhead is claimed for systematic pairing, relative to individual work; this overhead, it is claimed (again with some empirical support, though not entirely conclusive), is compensated by gains in code quality which usually entails significant maintenance penalties down the road.
