## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

code documentation is written information about the code, it can provide descriptions, definitions, and the reasoning behind the way the code was written. common forms of documentation include: Tutorials, READMEs, and howtos

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

code does not always read like a book, even if the logic and naming conventions make sense to the developer, after six months it may be nearly impossible to understand or remember how things work. Code Documentation explains what the responsibilities of functions are, why things were written the way they were, and clarifies the sometimes ambiguous naming conventions.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Without code documentation, code may be nearly impossible to update or troubleshoot, even by the creator, and very often the person trying to work on the code is not the person who wrote it originally. Therefore it is very important to provide clear and concise documentation, preferably embedded in, or accessible from, the code itself, so that when inevitable updates, refactoring, and bugs arise in the future, there is a resource to help interpret and navigate the code.
