## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

UX, or user experience, is every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services. That might sound like an exhausting number of situations to consider, but creating good UX design means focusing on the user, no matter where they are.

The goal of good UX is to help users do what they want to do when interacting with your business.

It may be tempting to only think about details that help communicate what you want people to know (like product information) and what you want them to do (like clicking the ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù button). But the goal of good UX is to help users do what they want to do when interacting with your business.

That‚Äôs why you should consider how your online and app experiences are making people feel. Are you confusing them? Are you coming off as cold and uncaring? Are you rushing them?

By keeping your audience‚Äôs feelings in mind, you can create strong UX that arranges all of your information and interactions in a way that‚Äôs pleasing to people. And, when the UX of your site or app makes people feel good, they‚Äôre more likely to stick around and become customers.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

If we can anticipate the user's experience with our app before they have that experience, we can prevent people from developing a negative view of our product. In psychology this exercise is called "perspective taking" and is the foundation for empathy and sympathy. We want to get into the shoes of everyone we are going to be interacting with through our business or product, we want to know what they see, think, and feel during that interaction. this information will help us tailor that experience in a way that conveys the image we want as a business, and hopefully it will help us drive the behavior of our clients as well.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

As I mentioned above the user experience is what drives user behavior. clients use websites that are convenient, feel secure, and are fun to look at. they develop loyalty towards companies that appreciate, value, and listen to them. with many competing products and businesses out there, clients will often go with the company they feel good about even if it is not the least expensive or the most functional.
