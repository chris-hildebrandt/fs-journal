## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

a row contains all the different properties for one item while a column contains a list of all the different values within a property group. while a row of animals may be listed with height, weight, color etc, the columns would contain the specific weights or heights of each animal on the list. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IN NOT EXISTS characters(
 id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 age INT NOT NULL,
 description VARCHAR(255)
)default charset utf8 COMMENT '';


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

DELETE FROM removes one row from the table, while drop table deletes the entire table and all info in it.
