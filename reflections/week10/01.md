## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.
a reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.
pointer types

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort
there seem to be a lot more of them... characters are considered a value instead of a string... lots of different kinds of decimal values.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

reference types are literally a reference to the actual place where the data is stored in memory, they are like pointers or roadsigns that show where the actual thing you want is located.
