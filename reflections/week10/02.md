## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

List in C# is a collection of strongly typed objects. These objects can be easily accessed using their respective index. Index calling gives the flexibility to sort, search, and modify lists if required. In simple, List in C# is the generic version of the ArrayList

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

generic list will be used a lot because we often request multiple pieces of data and the generic list allows us to get all of them in a way that can be utilized by the frontend. list.add seems useful, list.clear, list.contains, list.find list.findall, these are all familiar functions from when we were working with arrays and seem just as useful.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

list.find, list.finindex
