## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values. In the CSharp tradition, they are strongly typed. That means an enum of one type may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type, though the underlying value of their members is the same. Along the same lines, integral types and enums are not implicitly interchangeable. All assignments between different enum types and integral types require an explicit cast.

Enums lend themselves to more maintainable code because they are symbolic, allowing you to work with integral values but using a meaningful name to do so. For example, what type of code would you rather work with â€“ a set of values named North, South, East, and West or the set of integers 0, 1, 2, and 3 that mapped to the same values, respectively? Enums make working with strongly typed constants via symbolic names easy.

Enums are value types, which means they contain their own value, canâ€™t inherit or be inherited from, and assignment copies the value of one enum to another. You will see in this lesson and elsewhere that enums are used and referred to in both lower case, enum, and upper case, Enum. The relationship between the two is that the CSharp type, enum, inherits the Base Class Library (BCL) type, Enum. Use the CSharp type, enum, to define new enums and use the BCL type, Enum, to implement static enum methods.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

An enum is typically specified as shown in Listing 17-1 but may be customized by changing its base type and member values. By default, the underlying type of an enum is int. This default may be changed by specifying a base when declaring the enum. You would specify a different base if the enum was used extensively and there was an opportunity for space savings by selecting a smaller type. Another reason may be if you wanted the underlying type of the enum to correspond to another type in your program and you wanted to cast explicitly between the two without loss of precision. Valid base types include byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, and ulong.

Another modification you can make to an enum is to set the value of an enum member. By default, the first member of an enum takes the value of zero. If this value doesnâ€™t make sense for your enum, you can change it to one or some other number. Additionally, you can change any of the members of an enum to any value that is valid for its base type. Unassigned enum members have a value that is one more than their predecessor. Listing 17-2 shows how to modify the base type and member values of an enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not used them yet, but tags in allspice are essentially the same concept, I have a type value which is shown as a string, but most of my logic accesses the tags id rather than the string itself.
