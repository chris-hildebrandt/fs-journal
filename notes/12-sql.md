# MVC

4. create tables and begin writing methods for using database. models/controllers/services/repos.
5. begin frontend models, (for validation) pages, components, services.

final exam notes:

work across the fullstack from the beginning, as soon as you can create and get keeps you can build most of the front end

taking notes on devops lecture by ryan coates: azure devops looks a lot like github, but it has built in kanban style boards and integrated backlogs which is kind of nice, github and azure both have an "actions" component which allows you to run code including tests on every push of code. this allows for thousands of automated tests in the pipeline. npm and bcw do these things too. powershell is much more powerful than cmd. start using powershell!! bcw tool is a good example of automation, write your own autoamtion scripts. make your life easier! are there tasks we find ourselves doing repeatedly? automate it!

recommended books:
the devops handbook 2nd edition, 
the phoenix project  (less applicable)
the unicorn project
