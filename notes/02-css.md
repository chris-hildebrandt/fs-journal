/* allows us to make variables in css */

never text-align center your paragraphs dflex center makes the entire block more readable
/* utility class is a generalized class you can use for many different elements */

/* display flex helps make the content viewable across many different screen sizes and shapes. the flex allows the html displays top to bottom, d-flex does left to right */

/* em is a measurement based off of font size */

/* classes aded to a parent will apply those settings to their children */

/* be careful arranging the page with padding and margin, this will usually mess things up as the window changes size and shape */

/* justify is the d-flex for left to right and align is dflex up and down, so align-items: center, there is a little helper button in the inspector>styles which shows all the alignment options.*/
